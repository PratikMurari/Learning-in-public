**Benefits achieved:**
- **Better organization** - Each file has a specific purpose
- **Easier maintenance** - Simpler to find and fix issues
- **Better performance** - CSS and JS files can be cached by browsers
- **Code reusability** - Files can be used across multiple pages
- **Professional development structure** - Industry standard approach

**File structure:**
```
learners-academy-portal/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```
