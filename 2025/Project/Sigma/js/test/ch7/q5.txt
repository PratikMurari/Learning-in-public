Question:
Q5. Which of the following is used to look for the farthest ancestor that matches a given CSS selector?
(a) matches (b) closest (c) contains (d) none of these

Answer (chosen):
(d) none of these

Explanation:

matches: Tests whether the current element itself matches a selector; it does not traverse ancestors.

closest: Returns the nearest ancestor (or the element itself) matching the selector, not the farthest one.

contains: Checks node containment (whether one node contains another); it is not a selector-matching method for ancestors.
There is no built-in DOM API that directly retrieves the farthest matching ancestor in one call.
