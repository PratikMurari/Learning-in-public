<!-- Now finally, we can also incorporate JavaScript as an external file.
So instead of having a simple script tag we can have a script tag that has 
an external source and we specify the location of that file inside the attribute src-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Hello</h1> 


   <script src="./index.js"></script>

</body>
</html>

<!--Now, the thing that is interesting though is that the position inside the HTML document where we place the 
script tag matters a huge deal. With CSS, we tend to put it inside the head element so that it gets loaded up first 
before any of the content of our website, which tends to be inside the body. But with JavaScript it's the opposite story 
because if inside our script we tried to change an HTML element that does not yet exist then it will fail. 
(coz js is in head or before the element), So best practice is always to put the script right at the end 
just before the closing body tag. And the added benefit of this is, if you have a lot of JavaScript code, 
which usually is a little bit more time-consuming to run, then at least all of the content of your website 
will have been loaded up for the users to see, and the parts that they can't perceive, like the script code, 
happens afterwards,so your website looks like it loads faster, whereas if you put the script right at the top, 
and the browser has to go through all of the code before it can display all of the elements, 
then it might look like your website is taking a long time to load up, which nobody has the patience for, right?-->
